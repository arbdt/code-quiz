This contains content for BCS Homework 4: JS code quiz

The task for this project was to create a JavaScript Code Quiz website using JavaScript. It required a series of questions and answers, a timer, and the ability to save and load scores to/from local storage.
The page had to be dynamic, with responsive sizing and use of JavaScript to alter HTML elements and CSS styles.

No pre-made files were available for this, save for ![a gif that served as an example of the final product](./Assets/04-web-apis-homework-demo.gif).
This was a tricky task, in terms of working out the logic to run the quiz and display each set of questions and multiple-choice answers, determine correct or incorect user choices, work with the interval/timer, and save, load, and display the scores.
